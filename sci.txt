Additional Activities
I
what is it?The basic idea is that instead of 
being an invisible force that attracts objects 
to one another, gravity is a curving or warping 
of space. The more massive an object, the more 
it warps the space around it.
non example:hot air baloon
example:speed of falling ball and rocket
what is it like:curved ball



II
1.Gravity is a effect of massed object
2.light has a constant speed
3.curves in space is due to mass
4.wave is disturbance in space
5.time slows down in black hole
